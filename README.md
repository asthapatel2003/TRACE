# ⚙️ TRACE: Teen Risk Assessment and Classification Engine
> **A data-driven framework for early identification of high-risk adolescents for self-harm and suicide prevention in the United States.**

---

## 🧭 Project Overview
**TRACE** (Teen Risk Assessment and Classification Engine) is a predictive analytics system designed to identify and classify high-risk teens for suicide and self-harm in the United States.  
The project integrates **multi-domain datasets**—including school, healthcare, and demographic indicators—to build an **early warning and referral support system** for mental health professionals, schools, and public health agencies.

This initiative focuses on:
- Combining publicly available and simulated datasets ethically.  
- Using **machine learning** to model risk factors and predict vulnerability.  
- Visualizing actionable insights through **interactive dashboards** (Tableau / Power BI).  
- Supporting **data-informed intervention planning** at community and school levels.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Early Detection:** Identify adolescents showing signs of increased self-harm or suicide risk.  
- **Integration:** Merge behavioral, health, and demographic data safely and ethically.  
- **Prediction:** Use statistical and machine learning models to estimate near-term risk.  
- **Actionability:** Generate interpretable risk scores to support counselor interventions.  
- **Monitoring:** Track changes in risk and measure intervention impact over time.
